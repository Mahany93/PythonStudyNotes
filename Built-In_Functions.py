#-----------Built-In Functions => Map-----------#
#################################################
# [1] Map is used to apply a Function to a List, and crate a new List with the new values
# [2] Map is called Map, because it maps the Function on every element.
# [3] The Function can be Pre-Defined Function or Lambda Function.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Pre-Defined Function
# def formatText(text):
#     return f"- {text} -"

# myText = ["Mahmoud", "Ahmed", "Osama"]

# myFormattedData = map(formatText, myText)
# print(myFormattedData)

# for name in myFormattedData:
#     print(name)

#----------Built-In Functions => Filter---------#
#################################################
# [1] Filter Takes a Function + Iterator
# [2] Map runs a Function on every element.
# [3] The Function can be Pre-Defined Function or Lambda Function.
# [4] Filter out all elements for which the function return true.
# [5] The Function need to return Boolean Value.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# def checkNumber(num):
#     return num > 10

# myNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 16, 26, 36, 100]

#################################################
#----------Built-In Functions => Reduce---------#
#################################################
# [1] Reduce Takes a Function + Iterator.
# [2] Reduce run a Function on First and Second elements and gives results.
# [3] Then run on Result & Third element.
# [4] Then run on Result & forth element, and so on.
# [5] Till there is one element left, and this is the results of the Reduce.
# [5] The Function can be Pre-Defined Function or Lambda Function.
